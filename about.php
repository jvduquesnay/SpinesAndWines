                <h3>Cabernet Sauvignon</h3>
                <p>Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates. Cabernet Sauvignon is best paired with Psychological thrillers & suspense books like The Girl on the Train. The wine is heavy and dark, much like your own thoughts as you mull over the none-too-reassuring possibilities.</p>

                <p>Girl meets boy. Girl and boy fall in love. Either boy or girl, or both, meet horrific impending death or separation. In order to read this kind of popular love story trope, you'll need a Merlot to go with your Kleenex boxes. Merlot is both heavy and beautiful with a floral taste, pairing nicely with a modern-day Romeo and Juliet like the ones in An American Marriage.</p>

                <p>When reading about characters who are accustomed to money, the right wine will help you feel part of their world. Go for the gold with the most elitist and romantic wine you can buy. Let a good Pinot Noir (perhaps with a side of lobster) take you to Martha's Vineyard, lounging by a crystalline turquoise pool.</p>

                <p>Opening a book to a familiar world is as comforting as snuggling into a childhood blanket. Pair Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone with a warm mug of mulled wine and let the cinnamon, cider, and spices spark your senses and ready you for quotes, characters, or settings that you have come to know. Whether it's the next book in a series or simply a book you've read nine times before, mulled wine will set the tone as nostalgic and sweet as the Great Hall at Christmastime or Dumbledore's socks.</p>

                <p>Whether you're reading David Baldacci or another sweet suspense novel, try a White Zinfandel. Juicy, sweet, alcoholic, and zesty, it will make your read all the more engrossing and entertaining.</p>

                <h3>Sauvignon Blanc</h3>
                <p>For your strong, honest, badass memoir, try a Sauvignon Blanc. Tart and bold, it will perfectly match the rawness of an awareness-raising memoir, like Jessica Valenti's incredible and all-too-relatable Sex Object about the subtle (and not-so-subtle) everyday sexism women face.</p>

                <p>For the Delicious Mystery, this genre is a sugary-sweet guilty pleasure. As you tear through the pages of The Camel Club to uncover what exactly happened on that day everyone keeps alluding to, slow down to sip a sweet glass of Moscato and enjoy how maddeningly addictive they both are.</p>

Go for the gold with the most elitist and romantic wine you can buy, at least if Sideways has anything to say about it. Let a good Pinot Noir (perhaps with a side of lobster) take you to Martha's Vineyard, lounging by a crystalline turquoise pool.</p>

                <h3>Sangria</h3>
                <p>A good celebrity memoir is the ideal read immediately after reading something heavy. Often a bit lighter, quicker to flip through, and wildly funny, it pairs well with a fun glass of fruit-filled sangria. If well-done, it's a treat to read and by no means lacking substance, like Amy Schumer's The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo.</p>

                <h3>Rose</h3>
                <p>Perhaps it's because it's a saturated market, but many coming-of-age stories, especially set in New York City like in Sweetbitter, tend to attract a good amount of criticism, much like the scrumptious gift from the gods that is Rosé. Try a dry Rosé, because these stories often aren't easy and sugary sweet, but instead bruising and honest.</p>
